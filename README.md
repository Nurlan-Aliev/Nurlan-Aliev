# Hello, my name is Nurlan. 

I have always dreamed of a field where intellect is the primary focus, so my choice fell on tourism.

However, in 2020, like many others, I realized how crucial it is to choose a field that allows one to remain adaptable regardless of external conditions.

I made the decision that I want to find a sphere of activity where I won't be dependent on external factors.

After extensive searching, I came to the conclusion that programming is what I want to pursue. 

It inspires me and meets all my expectations.
